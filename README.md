## What's This Project About?

You may have hundreds or even thousands of images when you come back from several
trips. I bet they are pretty much un-organized (i.e., you don’t have to sort, categorize, and
annotate them). So, you end up with a large set of images sitting in a folder. Each time
when you want to find some photos to share with your friends, you may have to browse and
search them one by one from the very beginning. This is so frustrating. And we need a
smart way for this purpose. This is indeed an image retrieval system, in which you can do
googling on images (over your own image databases).
